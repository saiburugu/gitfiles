<h2>Who We Are </h2>
</b>
<p>Founding partners, Albert Rookard and Tim Carson, were looking for the right client web portal for their collection agency but could not find one that offered all the bells and whistles they were looking for. Their drive for perfection lead them to have a portal built for them, to their specifications. The result was the creation of ClientAccessWeb in 2000. A year later, their entrepreneurial spirit led them to start Applied Innovation, formerly known as ClientAccessWeb.com, to help other agencies enjoy the increased efficiencies and cost reductions they were now receiving.

Utilizing over 50 yearsâ€™ experience in the collections industry and over 75 in technology, Applied Innovation is helping to shape the future of accounts receivable management. Our product development is driven by customer feedback, agency profitability and compliance.
